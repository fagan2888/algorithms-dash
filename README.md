## Algorithms and Datastructure docsets for Dash

If you:
 * have [Dash](http://kapeli.com/dash) and enjoy using it for browsing documentation,
 * are learning or studying algorithms and data structures, and
 * think [Algorithms](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Algorithms) and [Data Structures](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Data_Structures) wikibooks are awesome source for learning.

Then these two docsets are for you.

To use them,
 * you can either download the generated documentation folders and open them with dash, or
 * copy and run the python file, it will generate the entire docset for you.
